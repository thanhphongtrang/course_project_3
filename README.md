This repo contains the clean data and the original data described in the course project lesson https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/peer/FIZtT/getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project
1. **Codebook.txt** file is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.
2. **run_analysis.R** file is he data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:
-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
-From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
3. **cleandata.txt** file is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
